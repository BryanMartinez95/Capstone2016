This is the order the controllers appear on the page in order of their parent
controller. Controllers on the same level are siblings and cannot see each other.
Controllers followed by '...' are not restricted to just appear under that specific
parent controller.

NOTE: Directives have their own scope. The parent scope of a directive is the lowest
level controller they sit in. For example, a numberpicker is placed on the Add User form.
The parent controller of the numberpicker will be the UserController.
